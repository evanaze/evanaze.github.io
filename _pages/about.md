I did my undergrad at UC Santa Barbara in Physics and Statistical Science with an emphasis in Probability and Statistics. Yes, that is really what it looks like. UCSB is one of the most beautiful Universities in the world. My professional experience includes data science projects, deep learning, financial metrics, creating production level code, and sharing insights.

This website contains a few of my selected projects and coursework, and links to my social media accounts. 

I am an avid guitar player. My interests are in finance and algorithmic trading, reading, cooking, and running.
