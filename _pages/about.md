I'm a graduate from UC Santa Barbara with experience in data science projects, deep learning, financial metrics, creating production level code, and sharing insights.

This website contains a few of my selected projects and coursework, and links to my social media accounts. 

I am an avid guitar player. My interests are in finance and algorithmic trading, reading, cooking, and running.
