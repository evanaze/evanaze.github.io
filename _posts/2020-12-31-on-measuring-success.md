As 2020 wraps up, I think it is a good time to reflect and look forward a bit to what has made me happiest and feeling most successful. 
If I have learned anything this year, it is that there are things you can control, and things you cannot control. 
One of the most powerful things you can control is what you allow into your life.  

I like this view of success, because it is pretty clear. 
I think it is amazing that there are only a few things that really matter to becoming the strongest, most capable and best version of yourself. 
It can be tempting to think of all the things in life that people want, and how much of it is not available to us, but if we dig down and ask "What would the best version of me have in spades?" I believe there are only three.
I call these three the three vectors of success.

## The Vectors of Success
If you have too many virtues you will become bogged down in having too many goals, and your direction will change constantly. 
But, neglecting one or more of these crucial dimensions of success will leave your life seriously lacking. 
As somebody who studied physics in college, I am a huge fan of simplicity and having only a few governing principles.
I believe that an arbitraty amount of complexity can arise from only a few simple elements and rules. 

I am open to more here, and to empirical evidence to support or reject these.
But I believe that you should be as *selfish* as possible for all things along these dimensions.
Nobody will make these happen for you, and even if they could, you wouldn't want them to.
Without further ado, let's get started.

### Career
This one is the most supported and well understood vector of success in our culture. 
It is what we traditionally think of as "success" if we lazily bring up the term in our mind.
The way I define it here, however, is a bit more broad.

I define the career vector as living up to your potential. 
It is all the things you "do" amounts to what impact you are able to have on the world.
What can you build? Who can you influence? These questions are answered and reflected by the strength of your career.



### Relationships



### Spirituality



## Making a Measurement



## Failure
