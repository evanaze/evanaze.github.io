As 2020 wraps up, I think it is a good time to reflect and look forward a bit to what has made me happiest and feeling most successful. 
If I have learned anything this year, it is that there are things you can control, and things you cannot control. 
One of the most powerful things you can control is what you allow into your life.  

This post is meant to be a whirlwind introduction to my thoughts on success and the practical philosophy I am developing.
Of course, nobody has the one answer and entire libraries can be written on the topic, but I thought it might be helpful for me to share my thoughts on the matter.

This post is partially inspired by Nietzche's book, Thus Spoke Zarathustra [^3]. 
The book is covers this topic and more and has a lot of great content on the subject, so if you are interested I definitely reccomend checking it out.
I will use ideas from the book in defining what I mean by "success" in this context.

## The Uberhuman

In the book, the main protagonist Zarathustra explains that the human is meant to be overcome.
He sees the Uberhuman as the actualization of the next evolution in man as a higher state of being.
This is represented in popular culture by the baby at the end of Stanley Kubrik's 2001: A Space Odyssey.

By Nietzche's definition, a true Uberhuman has likely not been born yet, and if they do exist they are incredibly rare and most people would not even know how to recognize one.
Basically, if you are reading this then you are unfortunately more human than Uberhuman due to the imperfections (such as trauma) that naturally come in as you lead a normal life.

In practical terms, we can think about this as self-actualization. 
We all have an image of the best versions of ourselves, and what we want our lives to look like.
My view of success is living in that space.
All of the elements in our lives are aligned in such a way that we are living in accordance with our highest selves.

Another way to put it would be living to the highest standard of our practical selves.
I think it is amazing that there are only a few things that really matter to becoming the strongest, most capable and best version of yourself. 
It can be tempting to think of all the things in life that people want, and how much of it is not available to us, but if we dig down and ask "What would the best version of me have in spades?" I believe there are only three.
I call these three the three vectors of success.

## The Vectors of Success
If you have too many virtues you will become bogged down in having too many goals, and your direction will change constantly. 
But, neglecting one or more of these crucial dimensions of success will leave your life seriously lacking. 
As somebody who studied physics in college, I am a huge fan of simplicity and having only a few governing principles.
I believe that an arbitraty amount of complexity can arise from only a few simple elements and rules. 

I am open to more here, and to empirical evidence to support or reject these.
But I believe that you should be as *selfish* as possible for all things along these dimensions.
Nobody will make these happen for you, and even if they could, you wouldn't want them to.
Without further ado, let's get started.

### Career
This one is the most supported and well understood vector of success in our culture. 
It is what we traditionally think of as "success" if we lazily bring up the term in our mind.
The way I define it here, however, is a bit more broad.

I define the career vector as living up to your potential. 
It is all the things you "do" amounts to what impact you are able to have on the world.
What can you build? Who can you influence? These questions are answered and reflected by the strength of your career.

This is where achievement becomes a large focus. 
Money, power, status, and fame are all symptoms of a great career.
But, they do not themselves define success.

Another way to think about this dimension would be to picture a patch of a forest.
Let's say you want to become a tree, out of all the things in this world you could be.
You are a stable person, you think long term, and you capable in being helpful and supporting others, so you become a tree.
Now you can succeed in many ways in your career as a tree. 

You can house generations of squirrels, birds, and other creatures. You can be the tallest tree in the forest, or the most scenic.
But in order to succeed and be the best you can be, you must be honest with yourself that your role is to be a tree.

#### Questions
Some questions you may want to ask yourself are:
* Am I good at what I do?
* Do I gain respect from people for my work? Do people value my work?
* Am I living up to my potential? Can I do more?

### Relationships
This domain is honestly the newest to me. 
I was of course interested in improving this part of my life, but also thought it was ok to just let happen naturally.
It was actually a shock to me that people made an effort to keep relationships open with people outside of doing what feels good. Shocking, right?

Humans are social animals and we almost all have a baseline level of socialability we must maintain for our health. 
If anything, I think the pandemic has highlighted this fact for many people.

The way I see this is that your relationship health is a factor of how much of yourself you can give to others. 
This can be anything from giving decades as a parent, to giving half an hour to reach out to a friend on the phone, to even giving up your living situation to be with someone else.

I see success here as a multiplicative effect, which is in part due to Metcalfe's law.
Metcalfe's Law [^4] states that the strength of a network increases by the square of the number of users. 
Originally applied to telecommunications, I like to extend this to quality of life and relationships. 
Having several positive relationships in your life can often combine to make things drastically better for yourself.

Of course, there is a limit here due to our mortal nature. We unfortunately have mouths and eyes, not routers and modems for making connections.
Scientists have suggested that people tend to form groups of roughly 100 to 150 people.
Any larger than that, and the group tends to fracture into sub groups and separate into a new group.

#### Questions
Some associated questions would be: how many people love me? What kind of impact do I have on others? If you asked my friends about our relationship, what would they say? What about my parents or my lovers? Are there people in my life that I can count on to be there for me, and can count on me?

### Spirituality

I believe that this vector of success is the least emphasized and least understood in our culture.
Spirituality does not necessarily mean religion, 
One way to look at spirituality is as the dot product between what you want to be, and what you are.
