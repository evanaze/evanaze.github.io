As 2020 wraps up, I think it is a good time to reflect and look forward a bit to what has made me happiest and feeling most successful. 
If I have learned anything this year, it is that there are things you can control, and things you cannot control. 
One of the most powerful things you can control is what you allow into your life.  

I like this view of success, because it is pretty clear. 
I think it is amazing that there are only a few things that really matter to becoming the strongest, most capable and best version of yourself. 
It can be tempting to think of all the things in life that people want, and how much of it is not available to us, but if we dig down and ask "What would the best version of me have in spades?" I believe there are only three.
I call these three the three vectors of success.

## The Vectors of Success
If you have too many virtues you will become bogged down in having too many goals, and your direction will change constantly. 
But, neglecting one or more of these crucial dimensions of success will leave your life seriously lacking. 
As somebody who studied physics in college, I am a huge fan of simplicity and having only a few governing principles.
I believe that an arbitraty amount of complexity can arise from only a few simple elements and rules. 

I am open to more here, and to empirical evidence to support or reject these.
But I believe that you should be as *selfish* as possible for all things along these dimensions.
Nobody will make these happen for you, and even if they could, you wouldn't want them to.
Without further ado, let's get started.

### Career
This one is the most supported and well understood vector of success in our culture. 
It is what we traditionally think of as "success" if we lazily bring up the term in our mind.
The way I define it here, however, is a bit more broad.

I define the career vector as living up to your potential. 
It is all the things you "do" amounts to what impact you are able to have on the world.
What can you build? Who can you influence? These questions are answered and reflected by the strength of your career.

### Relationships

This domain is honestly the newest to me. 
I was of course interested in improving this part of my life, but also thought it was ok to just let happen naturally.
It was actually a shock to me that people made an effort to keep relationships open with people outside of doing what feels good. Shocking, right?

Humans are social animals and we almost all have a baseline level of socialability we must maintain for our health. 
If anything, I think the pandemic has highlighted this fact for many people.
Some associated questions would be: how many people love me? What kind of impact do I have on others? If you asked my friends about our relationship, what would they say? What about my parents or my lovers? Are there people in my life that I can count on to be there for me, and can count on me?

The way I see this is that your relationship health is a factor of how much of yourself you can give to others. 
This can be anything from giving decades as a parent, to giving half an hour to reach out to a friend on the phone, to even giving up your living situation to be with someone else.

I see success here as a multiplicative effect, which is in part due to Metcalfe's law.
Metcalfe's Law [^4] states that the strength of a network increases by the square of the number of users. 
Originally applied to telecommunications, I like to extend this to quality of life and relationships. 
Having several positive relationships in your life can often combine to make things drastically better for yourself.

Of course, there is a limit here due to our mortal nature. We unfortunately have mouths and eyes, not routers and modems for making connections.
Scientists have suggested that people tend to form groups of roughly 100 to 150 people.
Any larger than that, and the group tends to fracture into sub groups and separate into a new group.

### Spirituality

One way to look at spirituality is as the dot product between what you want to be, and what you are.
